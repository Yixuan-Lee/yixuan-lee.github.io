## 2. General Solution 1

### 2.1 Idea

At each position, it has a "safe bound" which can keep the water. The "safe bound" is defined by the highest left wall and highest right wall of each position. As soon as we know the highest left wall and highest right wall, the water volume accumulated at position i can be formulated as:

$$accumulation[i] = min(left\_highest[i], right\_highest[i]) - height[i]$$

Comment: since when calculating the left highest and right highest, it considers the current height also, so *accumulation[i]* will be non-negative.

### 2.2 Implementation

The code implementation is [here](https://github.com/Yixuan-Lee/yixuan-lee.github.io/blob/master/assets/2020-09-11-Leetcode-42/src/general_solution_1.py).
