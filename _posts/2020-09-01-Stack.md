## 1. Stack

Stack is a data structure serving elements as Last-In-First-Out rules.

### 1.1 Operations

#### 1.1.1 Principle Operations

1. push: adds an element to the top of stack.
2. pop: removes and returns the top element if the stack is not empty.

#### 1.1.2 Auxiliary Operations

1. isEmpty: check if the stack is empty, return true if empty, otherwise false.
2. isFull: check if the stack is full.
3. size: return the size of stack.
4. top: return the top element, return -1 if stack is empty.
5. clear: empty the stack.
6. toString: return a list of concatenated elements as a string in stack for presentation.


#### 1.1.3 Auxiliary Functions

1. deepcopy: deep copy elements from the passing parameter
2. deepmove: deep move elements from the passing parameter
3. doublesize: expand the stack size and element-wisely copy

### 1.2 Advantages and Disadvantages

#### 1.2.1 Advantages

1. Fast insertion and removal.

#### 1.2.2 Disadvantage

1. Searching needs O(N) time.
2. Random Access is not allowed.

### 1.3 More Discussion

#### 1.3.1 Applications

1. Expression Evaluation
2. Backtracking (Recursion)
3. Postfix Evaluation
4. etc.

## 2. Implementation: Array-based Stack

Code directory: [/assets/2020-09-01-Stack/src/array_based](https://github.com/Yixuan-Lee/yixuan-lee.github.io/tree/master/assets/2020-09-01-Stack/src/array_based)

### 2.1 Performance

#### 2.1.1 Time Complexity

|  Function  |  Time Complexity  |
| ---------- | ----------------- |
|    push    |        O(1)       | 
|    pop     |        O(1)       |
|   isEmpty  |        O(1)       |
|   isFull   |        O(1)       |
|    size    |        O(1)       |
|    top     |        O(1)       |
|   clear    |        O(N)       |
|  toString  |        O(N)       |
|  deepcopy  |        O(N)       |
|  deepmove  |        O(N)       |
| doublesize |        O(N)       |

#### 2.1.2 Space Complexity

|  Function  |  Space Complexity |
| ---------- | ----------------- |
|    push    |        O(N) (may expand)       | 
|    pop     |        O(N)       |
|   isEmpty  |         -         |
|   isFull   |         -         |
|    size    |         -         |
|    top     |         -         |
|   clear    |         -         |
|  toString  |         -         |
|  deepcopy  |        O(N)       |
|  deepmove  |        O(N)       |
| doublesize |        O(N)       |

### 2.2 Advantages and Disadvantages

#### 2.2.1 Advantages

(TODO)

#### 2.2.2 Disadvatnages

1. Need to double the stack capacity when the stack is full, so many copy operation is needed.

### 2.3 More Discussion

When expanding the capacity, there are multiple ways to expand:

1. increase by a constant size
2. increase by doubling the size

Time complexity for approach \#1 is O(N^2).

Time complexity for approach \#2 is O(N).

## 3. Implementation: Linked-list-based Stack

Code directory: [/assets/2020-09-01-Stack/src/array_based](https://github.com/Yixuan-Lee/yixuan-lee.github.io/tree/master/assets/2020-09-01-Stack/src/linked_list_based)

### 2.1 Performance

#### 2.1.1 Time Complexity

|  Function  |  Time Complexity  |
| ---------- | ----------------- |
|    push    |        O(1)       | 
|    pop     |        O(1)       |
|   isEmpty  |        O(1)       |
|   isFull   |        O(1)       |
|    size    |        O(1)       |
|    top     |        O(1)       |
|   clear    |        O(N)       |
|  toString  |        O(N)       |
|  deepcopy  |        O(N)       |
|  deepmove  |        O(N)       |
| doublesize |        O(N)       |

#### 2.1.2 Space Complexity

|  Function  |  Space Complexity |
| ---------- | ----------------- |
|    push    |        O(1)       | 
|    pop     |        O(1)       |
|   isEmpty  |         -         |
|   isFull   |         -         |
|    size    |         -         |
|    top     |         -         |
|   clear    |         -         |
|  toString  |         -         |
|  deepcopy  |        O(N)       |
|  deepmove  |        O(N)       |
| doublesize |        O(N)       |


### 2.2 Advantages and Disadvantages

#### 2.2.1 Advantages

1. Comparing to ArrayStack, expanding the capacity is not necessary, so Space Complexity for push and pop is O(1).

#### 2.2.2 Disadvatnages

(TODO)
