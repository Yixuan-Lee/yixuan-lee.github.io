## 1. Graph

### 1.1 Operations

#### 1.1.1 Principle Operations

1. addVertex: insert a vertex
2. addEdge: insert an edge connecting two existing vertices
3. removeVertexById: remove the vertex with a provided id
4. removeVertexByValue: remove all the vertices with a provided value
5. removeEdge: remove an existing edge connecting two vertices
6. getEdgeWeight: retrieve the weight on a specific edge
7. updateEdgeWeight: update the weight on a specific edge
8. displayAdjList: print the adjacency list of the graph
9. getNumberOfVertices: retrieve the number of vertices in the graph
10. getNubmerOfEdges: retrieve the number of edges in the graph

#### 1.1.2 Auxiliary Operations

1. isEmpty: check if the current graph is empty

#### 1.1.3 Auxiliary Functions

1. removeVertexFromSideAdjListById: remove all GraphVertex nodes with the provided id in the side adjacency list

### 1.2 Types of Graph


### 1.3 Attributes

#### 1.3.1 Attributes on Directed Graph

Weighted/Un-weighted

#### 1.3.2 Attributes on Undirected Graph

Weighted/Un-weighted

### 1.4 Graph Traversal

#### 1.4.1 Breadth-First Search (BFS)


#### 1.4.2 Depth-First Search (DFS)

## 2. Directed Graph Implementation: Adjacency List

For simplicty, only implementation on directed graph is presented, since undirected graph is similar as directed graph. The only tiny differences are:

1. When adding an edge, it needs to add two edges which directions are opposite between two vertices.
2. When removing an edge, it needs to remove two edges which directions are opposite between two vertices.

### 2.1 Adjacency list diagram

For the graph (original *graph_3* in *testDriver.cpp*) shown below
