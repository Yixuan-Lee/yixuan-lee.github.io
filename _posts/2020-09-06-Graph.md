## 2. Directed Graph Implementation: Adjacency List

For simplicty, only implementation on directed graph is presented, since undirected graph is similar as directed graph. The only tiny differences are:

1. When adding an edge, it needs to add two edges which directions are opposite between two vertices.
2. When removing an edge, it needs to remove two edges which directions are opposite between two vertices.
