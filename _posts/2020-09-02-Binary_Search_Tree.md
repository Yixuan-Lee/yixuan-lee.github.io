## 1. Binary Search Trees (BST)

Binary Search Tree (BST) is a sorted binary tree where the rule `left node < root < right node` for every node in the tree satisfies.

### 1.1 Attributes

Attribute 1: At level i, the most nodes it can have is $$2^{i-1}$$.

Attribute 2: For a BST, the depth is $$\lceil log_2(n+1) \rceil$$ or equivalently $$\lfloor log_2{n} \rfloor + 1$$.



### 1.2 Implementation

### 1.3 Traversal

## 2. Implementation: Array-based BST

Code directory: [/assets/2020-09-02-Binary_Trees/array_based/](https://github.com/Yixuan-Lee/yixuan-lee.github.io/tree/master/assets/2020-09-02-Binary_Trees/src/array_based)

## 3. Implementation: Linked-Node-based BST
